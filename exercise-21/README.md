# Problem to Solve
This program manages a list of students, allowing users to add students with their name, age, and course. It ensures that duplicate student names are not added and displays the student list in a formatted table.

## Key Points to Consider
- **Data Storage:** The student records are stored in a dictionary where the key is the student's name, and the value is a list containing age and course.
- **Validation:** The program checks if a student's name already exists before adding them.
- **Instance Attributes:** The dictionary `students_list` is an instance attribute to avoid shared data across instances.
- **Formatted Display:** The student list is displayed in a structured table format for readability.
- **Naming Conventions:** The class and methods follow standard Python naming conventions for better code clarity.
