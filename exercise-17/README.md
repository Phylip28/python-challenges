# Problem to Solve  

This program generates a random string of lowercase letters and checks whether a given word exists within it. It allows users to search for words in either randomly generated strings or user-defined ones.  

## **Key Points to Consider**  

- The random string consists only of lowercase letters.  
- The program verifies if a word is present in the string while maintaining the character sequence.  
- The search is case-insensitive.  
- The user can choose between searching in a random string or a manually entered one.  
- Proper input validation is included to handle invalid cases.
