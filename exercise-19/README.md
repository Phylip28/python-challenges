# Problem to Solve  

This program checks whether a given text is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces and case sensitivity).  

## **Key Points to Consider**  

- The program removes all spaces from the input text.  
- It converts the text to lowercase to ensure case insensitivity.  
- If the input is empty, it prompts the user to enter a valid text.  
- It compares the cleaned text with its reversed version to determine if it is a palindrome.  
- The program outputs whether the text is a palindrome or not.
