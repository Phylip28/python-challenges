## Problem to Solve
The program calculates the maximum height of a pyramid that can be built using a given number of blocks. Each level of the pyramid requires an increasing number of blocks, starting from 1 block at the top, 2 blocks for the second level, 3 blocks for the third level, and so on.

## Key Points to Consider

- The user inputs the total number of blocks available.
- The program iterates through levels, adding the required number of blocks for each level until there are not enough blocks left to form the next level.
- The output is the maximum height of the pyramid that can be constructed with the given blocks.
- The program ensures that it does not exceed the given number of blocks while constructing the pyramid.
