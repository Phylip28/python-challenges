## Problem to solve:
The program checks whether two input strings are anagrams. An anagram is when two strings have the same characters, but in a different order. The program first removes spaces and converts both strings to lowercase. Then, it compares the sorted characters of both strings to determine if they are anagrams.

## Key points to consider:
- The user inputs two strings to compare.
- Both strings are converted to lowercase, and spaces are removed.
- If both strings are not empty, the program checks if they are anagrams by comparing their sorted characters.
- The program handles cases where either string is empty.
- The output will indicate if the strings are anagrams or not.
