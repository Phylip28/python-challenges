# Problem to Solve  

The program determines whether a given year is a leap year and calculates the number of days in a specific month of that year. It also includes a set of test cases to validate its correctness.  

## **Key Points to Consider**  

- A year is a leap year if:  
  - It is divisible by 4.  
  - If it is also divisible by 100, it must be divisible by 400 to be a leap year.  
- The program correctly assigns 29 days to February in leap years.  
- It handles years before 1582 and invalid months properly.  
- The test cases check whether the implementation returns the expected number of days for given year-month pairs.
