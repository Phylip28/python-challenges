## Problem to solve:
The program is a simple calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It runs in a loop, allowing the user to choose an operation until they decide to exit.

## Key points to consider:
- The program presents a menu with four arithmetic operations and an option to exit.
- The user selects an operation by entering a number (1-5).
- The program takes two numerical inputs and performs the selected operation.
- It uses a class-based approach where each arithmetic operation is defined as a method.
- The program continues running until the user chooses to exit.
- The program uses Python's `match-case` structure for decision-making (only available in Python 3.10+).
