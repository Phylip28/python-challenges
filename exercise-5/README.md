## Problem to solve:
The program implements a Caesar cipher, a simple encryption technique that shifts each letter in a message by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. The program allows users to encrypt or decrypt messages based on a shift value between 1 and 25.

## Key points to consider:
- The user selects an option: encrypt a message, decrypt a message, or exit.
- Encryption shifts each letter forward in the alphabet by a given shift value.
- Decryption shifts each letter backward using the same shift value.
- Spaces and digits remain unchanged.
- The program ensures the shift value is within the valid range (1-25).
- If an invalid option is chosen, the program notifies the user and prompts them again.
