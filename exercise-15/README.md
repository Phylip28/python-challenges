**Problem to Solve:**
This program converts a given numeric input into a 5-line LED-style representation. Each digit from 0 to 9 is displayed using a predefined pattern of `#` and spaces, mimicking the look of classic digital displays. The program ensures that only numeric inputs are processed and rejects non-numeric characters.

**Key Considerations:**
- The program supports only digits (0-9) and rejects any non-numeric input.
- Each number is represented in a 5-line format, maintaining alignment for multiple digits.
- The output mimics a 7-segment LED display using `#` symbols.
- Spaces are used to separate individual digits for readability.
- The implementation uses a predefined list for digit representation, ensuring efficiency and readability.
