## Problem to solve:
The program determines if a given year is a leap year or not. A leap year occurs every 4 years, but there are exceptions: 
- If a year is divisible by 100, it must also be divisible by 400 to be considered a leap year.
- The program also checks if the given year falls within the Gregorian calendar period (after 1582).

## Key points to consider:
- The user inputs a year.
- The program checks if the year is divisible by 4, 100, and 400 to determine if it is a leap year.
- If the year is less than 1582, the program will indicate that it is outside the Gregorian calendar period.
- The program uses two different methods to check if the year is a leap year, one using a function and the other using direct conditional checks.
