## Problem to solve:
The program implements the Collatz conjecture, also known as the "3n + 1 problem". It takes a positive integer and applies the following transformation repeatedly until the number becomes 1:
1. If the number is even, divide it by 2.
2. If the number is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
3. Repeat the process and count the number of steps required to reach 1.

## Key points to consider:
- The user inputs a positive integer.
- The program applies the Collatz transformation iteratively.
- The process stops once the number reaches 1.
- The program keeps track of and prints the number of steps taken.
- Each intermediate value is printed during execution.
