## Problem to solve:
The program calculates the Fibonacci sequence using two different approaches:
1. **Iterative approach:** Uses a loop to compute the Fibonacci number for a given position.
2. **Recursive approach:** Uses recursion to compute the Fibonacci number.

## Key points to consider:
- The Fibonacci sequence starts with 1, 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding numbers.
- The user can calculate Fibonacci numbers for positions `n â‰¥ 1`.
- The iterative approach is more efficient in terms of time complexity.
- The recursive approach follows the mathematical definition but is less efficient for large values of `n` due to redundant calculations.
- The program prints Fibonacci numbers for `n` from 1 to 10.
