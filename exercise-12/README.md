## Problem to solve:
The program calculates the factorial of a number for all numbers from 1 to a given input number `n`. It implements two different methods for calculating the factorial: an iterative approach and a recursive approach.

## Key points to consider:
- The program accepts a number `n` and calculates the factorial for all integers from 1 to `n`.
- The iterative approach uses a loop to calculate the factorial.
- The recursive approach calculates the factorial by calling the function within itself.
- The program handles negative input by returning `None` for invalid factorials.
