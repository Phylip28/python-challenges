# Problem to Solve  

This program implements a number-guessing game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The user has a maximum of 10 attempts to find the correct number.  

## **Key Points to Consider**  

- The secret number is randomly generated between 1 and 100.  
- The user receives feedback on whether their guess is too high or too low.  
- The game allows a maximum of 10 attempts.  
- If the user guesses correctly, they win immediately.  
- If they fail to guess within 10 attempts, they lose, and the correct number is revealed.  
- Proper input validation is required to handle non-integer inputs.
