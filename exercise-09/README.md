## Problem to solve:
The program reads a text file and counts the occurrences of each letter (ignoring spaces) in the file. It then writes the results to a new file, sorted by the frequency of each letter.

## Key points to consider:
- The user provides the name of the input file.
- The program counts the frequency of each letter (case-insensitive).
- The output is written to a new file with the same name as the input file, but with a `.hist` extension.
- The program handles input and output file errors gracefully using exception handling.
- The results are sorted in ascending order based on the frequency of each letter.
